# Fortinet Ansible Modules (Deprecated)

These Ansible "base code" modules have been superseded by the new Ansible Galaxy Collections for FortiOS and FortiManager, and are no
longer included in Ansible as of version 2.10.

Redhat has removed all vendor/partner modules from the Ansible Base Code, and moved everyone to Ansible Galaxy Collections.

Active maintenance and development for these "base code" modules has ended, and the new collections are to be used going forward, which is the new active project from Fortinet Engineering.
